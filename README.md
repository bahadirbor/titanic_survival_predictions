# Titanic Survival Prediction: Neural Network Model
This project contains a machine learning model developed using neural networks to predict the survival probabilities of passengers in the famous Titanic disaster.

## Project Overview
The Titanic disaster was a tragic event where the RMS Titanic sank after hitting an iceberg during its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, resulting in the loss of more than 1,500 lives. In this project, a deep learning model has been developed to predict survival probabilities using passenger demographics and ticket details.
Dataset
The dataset used in this project is from Kaggle's famous "Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster" competition. The dataset includes the following features:

- PassengerId: Passenger ID number
- Survived: Survival status (0 = Did not survive, 1 = Survived)
- Pclass: Ticket class (1 = 1st class, 2 = 2nd class, 3 = 3rd class)
- Name: Passenger name
- Sex: Gender
- Age: Age
- SibSp: Number of siblings/spouses aboard
- Parch: Number of parents/children aboard
- Ticket: Ticket number
- Fare: Ticket fare
- Cabin: Cabin number
- Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
